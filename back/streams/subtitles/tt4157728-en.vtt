2
00:02:05.608 --> 00:02:07.800
Mamma?

3
00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:09.177
Mamma.

4
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.589
Thank you.

5
00:02:25.594 --> 00:02:27.797
Help... Help me sit up.

6
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:37.607
I don't have much time.

7
00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:42.311
I have to know
you're going to be OK.

8
00:02:43.812 --> 00:02:46.246
I will be OK.

9
00:02:46.248 --> 00:02:48.150
Get the map.

10
00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:56.156
I know we've been through this
many times and that you know it,

11
00:02:56.158 --> 00:02:59.495
but just one more time, for me.

12
00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:02.766
Show me the route.

13
00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.376
And why this way?

14
00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:16.912
I stay as close
to the water as possible,

15
00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:20.684
for as long as I can.
The water keeps me safe.

16
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.551
- And this?
- Bad.

17
00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:27.422
- Why?
- The wind hides in the cities.

18
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:28.824
Where else?

19
00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:31.491
Open areas
where there's no water.

20
00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:33.630
And here?

21
00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:36.331
I must be careful.

22
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.534
Look, listen
and use the scanner.

23
00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:40.635
And?

24
00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.870
Never be in the open at night.

25
00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:44.171
Even near water.

26
00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:46.810
- You promise?
- I promise.

27
00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:51.314
Come over here.

28
00:04:07.897 --> 00:04:10.467
I wish we could have
gone there together.

29
00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:13.169
So do I.

30
00:04:28.886 --> 00:04:31.588
If I had known
what they did to me.

31
00:05:31.382 --> 00:05:32.781
Mamma?

32
00:05:32.783 --> 00:05:34.251
Mamma?

33
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.830
Who are you?

34
00:10:11.832 --> 00:10:16.370
- I'm Sira. Who are you?
- My name's Lilly.

35
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.671
What are you doing here?

36
00:10:19.673 --> 00:10:23.242
I was with some people
and then the wind came

37
00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:26.450
and we were running
and I got lost.

38
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.780
I saw a man last night.

39
00:10:27.782 --> 00:10:31.649
He was running from the wind.
Was he with you?

40
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:34.530
I don't know.

41
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.592
- OK. Well, I have to go now.
- Where are you going?

42
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.128
To the place that grants wishes.

43
00:10:43.364 --> 00:10:44.798
Can I come?

44
00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:48.202
OK.

45
00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:57.743
We have to be very quiet
until we get to water.

46
00:10:57.745 --> 00:10:58.946
I know.

47
00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:06.118
What's that?

48
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.755
- It can detect the wind.
- The wind that takes people?

49
00:11:09.757 --> 00:11:11.391
Yeah.

50
00:11:11.393 --> 00:11:13.228
And where did you get it from?

51
00:11:14.229 --> 00:11:16.631
My mother gave it to me.

52
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.217
Was he one of the people
you were with?

53
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:38.887
I don't know who that is.

54
00:12:13.455 --> 00:12:15.423
Can we talk now?

55
00:12:15.425 --> 00:12:20.260
- Yes, but quietly.
- So where is this place, then,

56
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.930
that grants wishes>

57
00:12:28.836 --> 00:12:31.238
Here. And we're here.

58
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.773
- That's far.
- Yes.

59
00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:35.242
And this place,
when you get there,

60
00:12:35.244 --> 00:12:37.878
you can wish for something
and it comes true?

61
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.813
- Yep.
- How do you know?

62
00:12:40.815 --> 00:12:44.184
- My mother told me.
- Is your mother here?

63
00:12:44.186 --> 00:12:48.424
No. No, she... she died.

64
00:12:50.426 --> 00:12:53.493
Are you gonna wish
for her to be alive again?

65
00:12:53.495 --> 00:12:56.963
How many wishes do you get
in this place? Just one?

66
00:12:56.965 --> 00:13:00.350
- I don't know.
- OK.

67
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:16.152
We can't go through there.

68
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.220
We have to go back and around.

69
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:13.410
Sira, your scanner.

70
00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:45.743
How did he do that?

71
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:49.278
I don't know.

72
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.448
He must have a special power.

73
00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:53.283
I don't know.

74
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:56.984
Do you think they might help us?

75
00:14:56.986 --> 00:14:58.289
No, Lilly.

76
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.193
It's getting late.

77
00:15:38.195 --> 00:15:40.231
We might have to stay
here tonight.

78
00:15:41.532 --> 00:15:43.567
We can't stay here.

79
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.270
Give me your bags.

80
00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.669
Empty your pockets.

81
00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.107
- Empty your pockets.
- I don't have anything.

82
00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:27.166
You, boy. Come with me.

83
00:18:47.621 --> 00:18:51.189
- What is this place?
- A refuge.

84
00:18:51.191 --> 00:18:54.593
- A refuge?
- A place of safety.

85
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.330
Wait!

86
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:16.214
I'll come and see you later.

87
00:19:16.216 --> 00:19:19.251
- It will be OK.
- Will it?

88
00:19:21.888 --> 00:19:25.492
It's a small price to pay for
the protection he affords us.

89
00:19:26.726 --> 00:19:28.427
You will get used to it.

90
00:19:52.886 --> 00:19:54.387
Sit down.

91
00:20:03.263 --> 00:20:04.497
What's this?

92
00:20:08.168 --> 00:20:11.706
The strong, silent type. Hmm?

93
00:20:12.873 --> 00:20:15.743
You use it to deflect the wind.

94
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.843
How? Show me.

95
00:20:18.845 --> 00:20:22.848
You know.
You used it in the field.

96
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.185
Not entirely accurate.

97
00:20:29.957 --> 00:20:33.324
You see, you're not the first
person to have one of these.

98
00:20:33.326 --> 00:20:35.628
Fellow who had this one
must've done something to it,

99
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.398
because I've not been able
to make it work and...

100
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.770
In testing it, it's...
Well, I think you know the rest.

101
00:20:44.772 --> 00:20:47.274
- You pretended?
- I pretended.

102
00:20:49.276 --> 00:20:52.278
- It was the water.
- Clever boy.

103
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.815
Yes.

104
00:20:56.417 --> 00:20:58.317
I know you know
about the effect

105
00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:00.853
bodies of water
have on the wind.

106
00:21:00.855 --> 00:21:03.422
I can see that from the route
you've marked on your map.

107
00:21:03.424 --> 00:21:04.890
But what you can't know

108
00:21:04.892 --> 00:21:08.427
is that if you configure
sufficient quantities of water

109
00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:11.632
in the right geometric pattern,
it has a similar effect.

110
00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:17.569
I'm with you.
I don't understand it either.

111
00:21:17.571 --> 00:21:19.371
It's a shame the chap
who came up with it

112
00:21:19.373 --> 00:21:21.175
isn't around any more.

113
00:21:21.742 --> 00:21:23.678
This map of yours...

114
00:21:28.348 --> 00:21:30.216
I know this area.

115
00:21:32.687 --> 00:21:34.588
There's nothing there.

116
00:21:39.695 --> 00:21:41.727
I'm going to ask you again.

117
00:21:41.729 --> 00:21:44.331
How do you make this
deflect the wind?

118
00:21:46.634 --> 00:21:50.269
You know, I could just beat it
out of you,

119
00:21:50.271 --> 00:21:52.538
but I don't think the women out
there would like it very much.

120
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.373
Contrary to what
you might think,

121
00:21:54.375 --> 00:21:55.776
they have their limits.

122
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:02.482
Fine.

123
00:22:02.484 --> 00:22:04.850
If you won't show me,
maybe your little friend will.

124
00:22:04.852 --> 00:22:08.456
- She doesn't know anything.
- We shall see.

125
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.224
Jenna!

126
00:22:15.363 --> 00:22:18.800
- Prepare the girl for a test.
- Yes.

127
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.851
Well, my dear. Our little friend
is proving a tad uncooperative.

128
00:22:37.853 --> 00:22:42.289
I'm hoping
this will change his mind.

129
00:22:44.426 --> 00:22:45.994
Now...

130
00:22:49.966 --> 00:22:51.768
What I want you to do...

131
00:22:53.702 --> 00:22:55.971
is walk to that flag.

132
00:23:01.644 --> 00:23:02.779
Off you go.

133
00:23:06.548 --> 00:23:07.783
I don't want to.

134
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.708
- Stay here.
- I don't want to.

135
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.712
Do you want your friend
to be hurt?

136
00:23:37.413 --> 00:23:38.648
No.

137
00:23:39.482 --> 00:23:40.882
Then stay here.

138
00:23:53.763 --> 00:23:58.599
- Why are we doing this?
- To ensure our survival.

139
00:23:58.601 --> 00:24:01.602
But it's not right.

140
00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:06.441
I think we're well beyond right
and wrong in this new world.

141
00:24:10.613 --> 00:24:12.981
Question me again...

142
00:24:12.983 --> 00:24:15.520
and you'll suffer
the same fate as the girl.

143
00:24:17.186 --> 00:24:20.423
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

144
00:24:21.157 --> 00:24:23.524
Good.

145
00:24:23.526 --> 00:24:29.432
Now, this is what happens
to those who don't cooperate.

146
00:24:30.766 --> 00:24:32.680
Please.

147
00:24:33.469 --> 00:24:34.871
Do the honours.

148
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.221
I was right!

149
00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:27.223
All of this
could've been avoided

150
00:25:27.225 --> 00:25:29.159
if you'd just played ball.

151
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:32.461
Take them back.

152
00:25:33.764 --> 00:25:35.497
The speaker device.

153
00:25:35.499 --> 00:25:38.568
Yes, please fetch it.

154
00:25:43.173 --> 00:25:44.508
No!

155
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.420
I'll do it.

156
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.130
After all, I wouldn't be
much of a protector

157
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.850
if I had you do it, right?

158
00:25:58.956 --> 00:26:01.791
As long as they believe
he protects them,

159
00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:03.227
we will never be free.

160
00:26:05.295 --> 00:26:07.300
It's the water
that stops the wind.

161
00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:11.167
It's his power.

162
00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:14.103
The power of the thing he has.
The same power as you.

163
00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:17.605
It only helps me control it.
It doesn't do anything else.

164
00:26:17.607 --> 00:26:20.440
The one he had was broken.

165
00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.614
What if you're wrong?

166
00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:27.850
I'm not.

167
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.597
Turn it off. Turn it off!

168
00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:47.232
Sira, do you mind
if I talk to Lilly alone?

169
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.306
OK.

170
00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:17.262
I'm sorry about what happened.

171
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:21.798
If we had known the truth,

172
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.603
we would never have let him
do the things he did.

173
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.410
I've spoken to Sira...

174
00:28:30.109 --> 00:28:32.778
and I understand
why he has to go.

175
00:28:33.946 --> 00:28:37.820
But you could stay here.
With us.

176
00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.251
I'm going with Sira.

177
00:28:41.253 --> 00:28:48.240
- Why? What's out there?
- A place that grants wishes.

178
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.294
And what will you do
when you get there?

179
00:28:50.296 --> 00:28:53.310
I will ask for my pappa back.

180
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.235
Have you told Sira?

181
00:28:59.139 --> 00:29:00.138
Why ever not?

182
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.406
Sira's going to wish for
his mother to come back

183
00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:06.420
and if there's only one wish,
he won't let me go with him.

184
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.913
How do you know
there's only one wish?

185
00:29:09.182 --> 00:29:11.215
I don't know.

186
00:29:11.217 --> 00:29:14.254
It's a long way to go
to find out.

187
00:29:15.155 --> 00:29:16.255
It's OK.

188
00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:19.158
It's already been a long way.

189
00:29:32.372 --> 00:29:34.841
I hope both your wishes
come true.

190
00:29:57.931 --> 00:30:00.967
- What did she say?
- She wants me to stay.

191
00:30:02.902 --> 00:30:05.471
- Do you want to stay?
- No.

192
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.942
Do you want me to stay?

193
00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:15.280
Well, it's still
a long way, Lilly.

194
00:30:15.282 --> 00:30:17.448
And look
what's happened already.

195
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.870
I don't care.
I know you'll protect me.

196
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.791
Yeah, but... what if I can't?

197
00:30:25.459 --> 00:30:27.940
I know you can.

198
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.139
Goodbye.

199
00:30:39.872 --> 00:30:41.741
And thank you.

200
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.759
Why doesn't the wind
chase the horses?

201
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.560
I don't know.

202
00:35:25.562 --> 00:35:28.230
It doesn't really care
about the animals.

203
00:35:48.518 --> 00:35:49.654
What is it?

204
00:35:54.124 --> 00:35:55.358
It's nothing.

205
00:36:25.523 --> 00:36:27.490
How the hell did you do that?

206
00:36:40.236 --> 00:36:43.273
Get behind me. Get behind me!

207
00:36:56.754 --> 00:36:58.589
I'm not gonna hurt you.

208
00:36:59.256 --> 00:37:00.524
Sira...

209
00:37:02.193 --> 00:37:06.262
It's getting late.
We have to go inside.

210
00:37:06.897 --> 00:37:08.332
He's right.

211
00:37:11.903 --> 00:37:15.971
- You know a place?
- There's a house.

212
00:37:15.973 --> 00:37:17.842
Just beyond those trees.

213
00:37:22.713 --> 00:37:23.849
OK.

214
00:37:57.649 --> 00:37:59.616
Hey, do you wanna keep an eye
on things down here,

215
00:37:59.618 --> 00:38:00.483
I'm just gonna go upstairs.

216
00:38:00.485 --> 00:38:03.686
I don't think
you're gonna need that.

217
00:38:03.688 --> 00:38:04.822
OK.

218
00:38:27.445 --> 00:38:28.778
All clear.

219
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.450
So, wanna get settled in
for the night?

220
00:39:32.879 --> 00:39:37.548
- What's that?
- A book of rhymes.

221
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.500
"The breezes at dawn
have secrets to tell you,

222
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.653
don't go back to sleep.

223
00:39:42.655 --> 00:39:45.220
You must ask for
what you really want,

224
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.591
don't go back to sleep.

225
00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:51.829
People are going back and forth
across the doorsill

226
00:39:51.831 --> 00:39:53.798
where the two worlds touch.

227
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.471
The door is round and open,
don't go back to sleep."

228
00:40:00.974 --> 00:40:02.708
Who's Rumi?

229
00:40:04.877 --> 00:40:08.780
- He was a poet.
- Is he still alive?

230
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.317
No. He died a long time ago.

231
00:40:20.593 --> 00:40:24.564
Well, I hope you like beans.

232
00:40:25.531 --> 00:40:27.500
Hmm, could be worse, right?

233
00:40:33.406 --> 00:40:35.742
So what's your story?

234
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.583
- It's OK, I...
- No, it's not you. It's...

235
00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:50.922
I haven't had many conversations
in the last three months, so...

236
00:40:50.924 --> 00:40:55.528
I'm British Army, actually,
stationed out in Lympstone.

237
00:40:56.596 --> 00:40:59.998
I was on leave.

238
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.968
I'd just, just got married.

239
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:08.907
Then I was emergency recalled
to my base.

240
00:41:08.909 --> 00:41:11.843
Time I got there,
all hell had broken loose

241
00:41:11.845 --> 00:41:13.945
and nobody was there.

242
00:41:13.947 --> 00:41:17.849
So I just spent the last three
months heading back here to...

243
00:41:17.851 --> 00:41:19.753
try and find my wife.

244
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:24.992
I saw the kids and here we are.

245
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.830
Did you find your wife?

246
00:41:30.898 --> 00:41:32.320
No.

247
00:41:33.166 --> 00:41:34.501
I'm sorry.

248
00:41:37.872 --> 00:41:39.700
What about you?

249
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.673
Oh, I teach.

250
00:41:41.675 --> 00:41:46.745
Taught. Electromagnetics at
a university not far from here.

251
00:41:46.747 --> 00:41:49.480
We were monitoring
routine collision data

252
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.784
through from CERN.
Nothing special. Yeah.

253
00:41:52.786 --> 00:41:55.856
Usual night shift for me,
given I had no social life.

254
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:59.125
I went to the bathroom
and when I came back,

255
00:41:59.127 --> 00:42:03.940
everyone had disappeared
and all the equipment was dead.

256
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.630
The only clue was a print-out

257
00:42:05.632 --> 00:42:09.137
which showed a huge spike
just before everything stopped.

258
00:42:15.208 --> 00:42:17.108
It's the...
What is this all about, here?

259
00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:20.947
Oh, uh, random output noise
from the spike.

260
00:42:20.949 --> 00:42:22.748
So this is from CERN?

261
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.917
- Hadron Collider, right?
- Yeah.

262
00:42:24.919 --> 00:42:29.550
Something happened there
and now most of us are gone.

263
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.910
And at the same time, something
else has come into our world

264
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.194
that seems pretty intent
in finishing off the rest of us.

265
00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:38.831
Whatever it is,
it's drawn to artificial sound.

266
00:42:38.833 --> 00:42:40.767
That's why
the cities went first.

267
00:42:41.903 --> 00:42:45.104
When you say "it",

268
00:42:45.106 --> 00:42:47.942
you're speaking about
the wind, right?

269
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:51.212
Yeah.

270
00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.916
"But when he saw the wind,
he was afraid.

271
00:42:56.918 --> 00:42:59.530
He cried out, 'Lord, save me!'"

272
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.889
- What's that? The Bible?
- It is.

273
00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:06.661
So you think
this is an act of God?

274
00:43:07.662 --> 00:43:08.796
Maybe.

275
00:43:09.697 --> 00:43:11.233
Truthfully, I don't know.

276
00:43:13.135 --> 00:43:15.735
Are you Christian?

277
00:43:15.737 --> 00:43:17.970
Aren't you supposed to be
a pacifist?

278
00:43:17.972 --> 00:43:19.572
"Thou shalt not kill,"
and all that.

279
00:43:19.574 --> 00:43:21.141
Yeah.

280
00:43:21.143 --> 00:43:23.110
Times like this,
it gets complicated, right?

281
00:43:23.112 --> 00:43:26.150
It's pretty simple now,
there's no one left.

282
00:43:29.217 --> 00:43:31.817
How did you make it out alive?

283
00:43:31.819 --> 00:43:37.860
That night, I was taking
a cold shower to wake myself up.

284
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.361
The water around me
and in the pipes...

285
00:43:41.363 --> 00:43:43.330
I guess it all added up.

286
00:43:43.332 --> 00:43:45.664
But I thought it was just
large bodies of water

287
00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:46.466
that repelled the wind?

288
00:43:46.468 --> 00:43:48.902
Smaller, geometric
configurations

289
00:43:48.904 --> 00:43:51.371
seem to work sometimes,
sometimes not.

290
00:43:51.373 --> 00:43:53.140
It's like the rain.

291
00:43:53.142 --> 00:43:57.177
It doesn't do much
but slow it down. It's weird.

292
00:43:57.179 --> 00:43:59.346
I mean,
we're mostly water, right?

293
00:43:59.348 --> 00:44:00.983
I don't make the rules.

294
00:44:02.385 --> 00:44:04.384
I was on my way
to a former professor's place

295
00:44:04.386 --> 00:44:06.319
not far from here
and I got caught short

296
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:07.720
and the rest, you know.

297
00:44:07.722 --> 00:44:09.689
And what's at
your professor's place?

298
00:44:09.691 --> 00:44:13.361
Equipment that still works.
I hope.

299
00:44:13.363 --> 00:44:15.795
Anything that was running
at the time of the event

300
00:44:15.797 --> 00:44:18.865
- is permanently dead.
- You have any theories?

301
00:44:18.867 --> 00:44:22.202
Theories? Oh, yeah.

302
00:44:22.204 --> 00:44:24.673
A way to prove them? No.

303
00:44:26.342 --> 00:44:27.974
Until now.

304
00:44:27.976 --> 00:44:30.770
The boy?

305
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.412
You see the way
he used that scanner.

306
00:44:32.414 --> 00:44:35.820
The effect it had on the wind.

307
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.783
Stopped it in its tracks.

308
00:44:36.785 --> 00:44:38.785
If we can replicate that,
we've got a way

309
00:44:38.787 --> 00:44:41.254
of protecting ourselves, while
we try and figure this out.

310
00:44:41.256 --> 00:44:45.426
- Maybe even reverse it.
- That kit he has.

311
00:44:45.428 --> 00:44:48.229
I'd say, in my opinion,
it's military.

312
00:44:48.231 --> 00:44:51.665
Build quality, all of it.

313
00:44:51.667 --> 00:44:54.690
But I've never seen
anything like it.

314
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.173
We should bring him down here.

315
00:45:08.851 --> 00:45:11.685
Sira...

316
00:45:11.687 --> 00:45:15.230
That scanner you used out there,
where did you get it?

317
00:45:16.191 --> 00:45:18.259
My mother gave it to me.

318
00:45:18.261 --> 00:45:20.290
Where did she get it?

319
00:45:21.231 --> 00:45:22.866
I don't know.

320
00:45:25.835 --> 00:45:27.403
Can I take a look?

321
00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.359
What did your mum do?

322
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:53.263
She worked for the government.

323
00:45:55.165 --> 00:45:58.990
What did she do for them?

324
00:45:58.101 --> 00:46:02.300
I'm not sure. She didn't really
like to talk about her work.

325
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.839
Where is she now?

326
00:46:11.448 --> 00:46:12.982
Gone.

327
00:46:17.387 --> 00:46:20.190
I'm so... I'm sorry.

328
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.200
How did you deflect the wind?

329
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:36.238
Well, in my mind,
I make the blue and green lines

330
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.743
the same as the red
and well, the wind just stops.

331
00:46:41.512 --> 00:46:44.213
Can I ask you, did you, um...

332
00:46:44.215 --> 00:46:47.384
Did your mother
show you how to do that?

333
00:46:48.452 --> 00:46:50.540
Yeah.

334
00:46:52.121 --> 00:46:55.125
- But how did she know?
- I'm not sure.

335
00:46:58.896 --> 00:47:00.300
OK.

336
00:47:03.534 --> 00:47:06.103
Do you mind if I ask
where you two are headed?

337
00:47:09.139 --> 00:47:10.973
To the place that grants wishes.

338
00:47:10.975 --> 00:47:14.780
- Wishes?
- And what happens there?

339
00:47:15.179 --> 00:47:16.813
You make a wish.

340
00:47:18.282 --> 00:47:20.840
And it comes true?

341
00:47:21.218 --> 00:47:22.853
Yep.

342
00:47:24.489 --> 00:47:27.888
- Where is this place?
- I'll show you.

343
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.192
- Sira!
- It's OK.

344
00:47:30.194 --> 00:47:32.229
You can trust us.

345
00:47:36.301 --> 00:47:41.303
We're here. And...
This is the place.

346
00:47:41.305 --> 00:47:43.472
Did you make this?

347
00:47:43.474 --> 00:47:46.110
No, my mother did.

348
00:47:47.945 --> 00:47:51.181
Can I ask how your mother knew
where this place was?

349
00:47:51.882 --> 00:47:53.350
I don't know.

350
00:47:54.218 --> 00:47:55.919
Thank you, Sira.

351
00:48:02.227 --> 00:48:05.561
My mother told me to stay away
from people in uniforms.

352
00:48:05.563 --> 00:48:08.980
Especially soldiers.

353
00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:23.181
Well, uh, I'd say your mother
gave you good advice, Sira.

354
00:48:24.949 --> 00:48:26.984
Have you ever killed someone?

355
00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:31.589
I have.

356
00:48:33.391 --> 00:48:34.526
Why?

357
00:48:38.296 --> 00:48:39.397
I don't know.

358
00:48:43.301 --> 00:48:49.207
You two must be tired, hmm?
You go and get some rest.

359
00:49:31.116 --> 00:49:33.170
So what do you make of all this?

360
00:49:36.222 --> 00:49:39.880
There's something in
what the boy is saying.

361
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.290
This place
they're travelling to,

362
00:49:41.292 --> 00:49:43.293
I've heard reports
of places like it,

363
00:49:43.295 --> 00:49:45.564
where wishes are fulfilled.

364
00:49:46.198 --> 00:49:47.299
Wishes?

365
00:49:48.601 --> 00:49:50.667
Do you believe that?

366
00:49:50.669 --> 00:49:54.203
Our world is upside down.

367
00:49:54.205 --> 00:49:57.740
I have no rational basis
upon which to deny or accept it.

368
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.430
All I know
is that the boy believes it

369
00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:04.213
and he has demonstrated a power
that we need to survive.

370
00:50:04.215 --> 00:50:07.451
That's why
we've got to protect him.

371
00:50:07.453 --> 00:50:11.157
- Spoken like a true soldier.
- No, it's not that.

372
00:50:13.292 --> 00:50:15.126
He's just a young boy.

373
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.362
With what he's shown us
he can do,

374
00:50:18.364 --> 00:50:21.198
he could be exploited.
I mean, he's valuable.

375
00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.636
- And not just to us.
- And where will you take him?

376
00:50:24.638 --> 00:50:27.571
Army base? None of those left.

377
00:50:27.573 --> 00:50:29.475
I don't know, Jesse.

378
00:50:32.511 --> 00:50:35.212
The scanners,
you think about it...

379
00:50:35.214 --> 00:50:37.749
Where there's one,
there must be more, right?

380
00:50:37.751 --> 00:50:40.451
Maybe he can teach us how
to use them, protect ourselves.

381
00:50:40.453 --> 00:50:42.254
Maybe even protect other people.

382
00:50:43.522 --> 00:50:47.900
You're curious about this place.

383
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.610
Yeah, I'm just trying
to get my head around it.

384
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.596
So what if his mother is right
about this place?

385
00:50:52.598 --> 00:50:54.298
That what you wish for
came true.

386
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.267
Surely someone
would've wished for this wind

387
00:50:57.269 --> 00:50:59.304
to stop doing
whatever it's doing.

388
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:02.606
I don't know. Worth a trip
to find out, though.

389
00:51:02.608 --> 00:51:06.613
I mean, unless you've
got something better to do?

390
00:51:10.283 --> 00:51:12.319
Do you think
they'll come with us?

391
00:51:13.753 --> 00:51:15.620
I don't know.

392
00:51:15.622 --> 00:51:18.492
Do you think they have wishes
they want to come true?

393
00:51:19.493 --> 00:51:21.659
Well, probably.

394
00:51:21.661 --> 00:51:24.596
What if the wish only comes true
for you because you're special?

395
00:51:24.598 --> 00:51:26.465
I don't know, Lilly.

396
00:51:28.367 --> 00:51:30.468
OK, then.

397
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.507
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Lilly.

398
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:36.677
You believe the boy.

399
00:51:38.545 --> 00:51:40.612
I was never one for fairy tales.

400
00:51:40.614 --> 00:51:44.349
The way I see it,
this place, if it does exist,

401
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:47.620
is another anomaly
and one I can learn from.

402
00:51:47.622 --> 00:51:50.356
What, research? With what?
We've got no equipment, nothing.

403
00:51:50.358 --> 00:51:52.423
My professor's place
is not far from here.

404
00:51:52.425 --> 00:51:55.560
I'm hoping he'll have
what I'm looking for.

405
00:51:55.562 --> 00:51:57.529
Yeah, I saw where
that place is on the map too.

406
00:51:57.531 --> 00:52:01.199
Landlocked,
no large bodies of water,

407
00:52:01.201 --> 00:52:03.434
which means no protection
for any of us.

408
00:52:03.436 --> 00:52:06.771
And if memory serves me correct,
the route from the army base

409
00:52:06.773 --> 00:52:09.173
on the coast to here doesn't
have a whole lot of water,

410
00:52:09.175 --> 00:52:11.812
so how did you do it, Jay?

411
00:52:13.614 --> 00:52:15.780
Training.

412
00:52:15.782 --> 00:52:20.186
Trained to be silent,
attuned to our environment.

413
00:52:22.623 --> 00:52:25.758
I learnt that I could sense when
the wind was getting close.

414
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.193
- How?
- Change in air pressure,

415
00:52:29.195 --> 00:52:30.831
background noise.

416
00:52:33.367 --> 00:52:35.336
Caught me off guard sometimes.

417
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:39.137
Used the rifle and suppressor.

418
00:52:39.139 --> 00:52:41.239
Throw sound, hit a target,
make some noise,

419
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:42.875
the wind would hear it,
go towards the sound,

420
00:52:42.877 --> 00:52:47.446
and I would...
I would slip away.

421
00:52:47.448 --> 00:52:49.751
That's what
you were doing out there.

422
00:52:50.818 --> 00:52:52.419
In the field.

423
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:57.156
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

424
00:52:57.158 --> 00:53:00.392
Well, you know, the wind
did get pretty close to you.

425
00:53:00.394 --> 00:53:02.561
- That's quite smart.
- Well, yeah, maybe.

426
00:53:02.563 --> 00:53:04.463
Well, until I tried to outrun it
in a Jeep,

427
00:53:04.465 --> 00:53:06.932
which actually
didn't end so well.

428
00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:10.804
- Still, you're here, so...
- Barely.

429
00:53:10.806 --> 00:53:14.173
What about you?
How did you survive so long?

430
00:53:14.175 --> 00:53:17.776
Well, blind luck mostly...

431
00:53:17.778 --> 00:53:20.815
which run out just before
our boy intervened.

432
00:53:22.216 --> 00:53:24.584
The way I see it,
with you and Sira,

433
00:53:24.586 --> 00:53:26.621
we should be in safe hands.

434
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.435
OK, Jesse.

435
00:53:44.472 --> 00:53:48.443
OK. Count me in.

436
00:53:53.481 --> 00:53:55.314
Then that's settled.

437
00:53:55.316 --> 00:53:57.617
We head off early,
go the professor's place,

438
00:53:57.619 --> 00:53:59.721
- pick up what we need...
- Shh.

439
00:54:57.814 --> 00:54:59.214
It's leaving.

440
00:55:06.788 --> 00:55:07.924
OK.

441
00:56:35.112 --> 00:56:36.912
How are they?

442
00:56:36.914 --> 00:56:38.480
They're fine.

443
00:56:38.948 --> 00:56:41.818
Good... good.

444
00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.389
You should get some rest.

445
00:56:47.524 --> 00:56:51.327
Yeah, I will. You too.

446
00:57:47.919 --> 00:57:50.850
Jay and I
had a long talk last night

447
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:52.489
and we would both like
to come with you to this place.

448
00:57:54.925 --> 00:57:56.600
OK.

449
00:57:57.161 --> 00:58:00.863
- Lilly?
- Sira said OK.

450
00:58:00.865 --> 00:58:02.597
But we do need to make a detour.

451
00:58:02.599 --> 00:58:05.569
- How far?
- I can show you on your map.

452
00:58:17.581 --> 00:58:20.950
No, no, no.
That's too close to the city.

453
00:58:20.952 --> 00:58:23.719
What difference does that make?
The cities are dead.

454
00:58:23.721 --> 00:58:27.123
The wind hides in the cities.
It's where it sleeps.

455
00:58:27.125 --> 00:58:31.559
But we have you and your scanner
and we'll be extra careful.

456
00:58:31.561 --> 00:58:34.964
No, my scanner can't detect
the wind if it's sleeping.

457
00:58:34.966 --> 00:58:38.600
- Only if it's awake.
- Sira, listen.

458
00:58:38.602 --> 00:58:41.904
We understand why you're afraid
to go to the city, we really do.

459
00:58:41.906 --> 00:58:44.400
And you're right,
it's dangerous. Very dangerous.

460
00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.942
We're not gonna lie to you,
but I can hear it,

461
00:58:45.944 --> 00:58:48.440
I can divert it,
I've done it before.

462
00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:49.914
Why do you need to go there?

463
00:58:53.151 --> 00:58:56.852
I think,
with the right equipment...

464
00:58:56.854 --> 00:58:59.855
we may be able to find out
how you do what you do

465
00:58:59.857 --> 00:59:03.590
and then make a machine do it,
so you don't have to.

466
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:05.129
You could do it for all of us?

467
00:59:06.631 --> 00:59:07.964
I guess...

468
00:59:07.966 --> 00:59:12.803
OK, then. We'll go.
Get the equipment.

469
00:59:12.805 --> 00:59:15.237
- No!
- Why?

470
00:59:15.239 --> 00:59:17.306
I told you, it's too dangerous.

471
00:59:17.308 --> 00:59:20.760
But Jay can help us
and you can keep us safe.

472
00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.648
- Not in the city, Lilly.
- Well, I'm going.

473
00:59:27.719 --> 00:59:28.853
Fine.

474
00:59:31.256 --> 00:59:32.890
Sira?

475
00:59:33.691 --> 00:59:34.960
Sira.

476
00:59:36.795 --> 00:59:39.197
Sira, you need to think about
all of us from now on.

477
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:43.202
Sira.

478
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:51.642
Now what?

479
01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.228
Jesse, Jesse!

480
01:00:11.997 --> 01:00:14.264
What are you thinking?

481
01:00:14.266 --> 01:00:18.869
- We can't just leave him.
- I think he's leaving us.

482
01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:22.105
- It has to be his decision.
- No.

483
01:00:22.107 --> 01:00:23.542
We have to be the adults here.

484
01:01:13.326 --> 01:01:15.192
There it is.

485
01:01:15.194 --> 01:01:18.929
- That's where he lives?
- Yeah.

486
01:01:18.931 --> 01:01:20.834
It's a big place.

487
01:01:22.735 --> 01:01:25.138
Got a problem with big places?

488
01:01:26.439 --> 01:01:27.773
Let's go.

489
01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:22.294
What's wrong?

490
01:02:22.296 --> 01:02:25.130
- I'm not going in there.
- Me neither.

491
01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:27.400
You gonna be OK out here?

492
01:02:31.172 --> 01:02:32.306
OK.

493
01:02:38.378 --> 01:02:39.712
Now what?

494
01:02:41.114 --> 01:02:42.815
We wait outside.

495
01:03:50.351 --> 01:03:51.885
Marcus?

496
01:03:56.191 --> 01:03:57.525
Marcus?

497
01:04:45.473 --> 01:04:47.476
Is that him?

498
01:04:49.943 --> 01:04:51.546
Downstairs, you think?

499
01:04:55.383 --> 01:04:58.987
Marcus, you idiot!

500
01:05:01.257 --> 01:05:02.424
I'm sorry.

501
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.310
Scanners.

502
01:05:31.554 --> 01:05:32.987
It works.

503
01:05:36.158 --> 01:05:38.159
So what is all this stuff?

504
01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:44.198
Particle and quantum physics.

505
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.690
A lot of it's analysis
of CERN data, but...

506
01:05:49.472 --> 01:05:51.474
most of it's beyond me.

507
01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:55.411
<i>Is that your mum?</i>

508
01:05:56.612 --> 01:05:59.281
- Yeah.
- She's pretty.

509
01:06:03.486 --> 01:06:06.220
She looks sad.

510
01:06:06.222 --> 01:06:08.424
She didn't want
to leave me on my own.

511
01:06:09.425 --> 01:06:11.160
You're not on your own.

512
01:06:16.165 --> 01:06:20.567
- What about your mum?
- She died when I was little.

513
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:23.103
My pappa brought me up.

514
01:06:23.105 --> 01:06:25.740
Don't know where he is now.

515
01:06:26.975 --> 01:06:30.413
- Have you got a picture?
- No.

516
01:06:35.285 --> 01:06:38.287
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

517
01:06:39.688 --> 01:06:41.490
We're in business.

518
01:06:51.367 --> 01:06:54.437
Turn it off now, turn it off!
Get your things. We're leaving.

519
01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:56.673
Not without this.

520
01:07:09.219 --> 01:07:10.353
Run!

521
01:08:32.703 --> 01:08:34.605
We shouldn't have come here.

522
01:09:57.689 --> 01:09:59.424
I'm gonna go speak to him.

523
01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.235
Sira.

524
01:10:15.373 --> 01:10:16.508
I'm sorry.

525
01:10:19.845 --> 01:10:21.613
Sorry we didn't listen to you.

526
01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:25.483
And I truly wish
she was still here.

527
01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:30.889
You're a brave boy.

528
01:10:33.392 --> 01:10:34.894
I'm glad you're with us.

529
01:10:39.731 --> 01:10:41.233
Get some rest.

530
01:11:05.657 --> 01:11:06.959
Was it worth it?

531
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.965
That's not fair.

532
01:11:19.872 --> 01:11:21.541
I'm sorry.

533
01:11:31.751 --> 01:11:34.554
I think it can replicate
what he can do.

534
01:11:36.622 --> 01:11:39.890
I need to calibrate it
so it deflects

535
01:11:39.892 --> 01:11:41.928
instead of attracts the wind.

536
01:11:43.329 --> 01:11:44.630
How?

537
01:11:48.401 --> 01:11:51.269
I'll do it the next time
he does his thing.

538
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:53.773
Will that work?

539
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:56.709
I'm not sure.

540
01:11:58.544 --> 01:12:01.546
I'm not sure of anything
any more.

541
01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:07.487
How much further?

542
01:12:10.556 --> 01:12:13.693
According to his map,
it's still half a day away.

543
01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:17.430
What do you think
he'll wish for?

544
01:12:19.465 --> 01:12:20.968
I think it's obvious.

545
01:12:21.835 --> 01:12:23.570
I don't know.

546
01:12:24.805 --> 01:12:26.305
What about you?

547
01:12:29.575 --> 01:12:31.744
For everything to be as it was.

548
01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:34.615
Right.

549
01:12:37.884 --> 01:12:39.952
Why, what's wrong with that?

550
01:12:43.757 --> 01:12:45.458
Look around, Jess.

551
01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:51.864
The world seems like it's doing
pretty good without us.

552
01:12:54.367 --> 01:12:58.537
So what, we just give up, yeah?

553
01:12:58.539 --> 01:12:59.938
Return to the Garden of Eden,

554
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:03.507
but this there's time no
Adam and Eve to mess things up?

555
01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:05.311
Would that be so bad?

556
01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:11.830
Out there... the world.

557
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:13.553
What's so broken
that needs fixing?

558
01:13:14.554 --> 01:13:16.223
I want to survive.

559
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:22.396
Yeah, of course.

560
01:13:23.764 --> 01:13:24.899
Of course.

561
01:13:27.466 --> 01:13:30.103
Hey, Jesse, it's OK.

562
01:13:31.138 --> 01:13:32.439
It's OK.

563
01:13:34.575 --> 01:13:37.476
Get some rest, eh?
We have a long day tomorrow.

564
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:47.588
Copy that.

565
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:11.112
Rested?

566
01:14:15.883 --> 01:14:18.190
We thought we'd lost you
for a second.

567
01:14:27.128 --> 01:14:28.428
Come on.

568
01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:37.465
We need to get out of here,
come on.

569
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:43.172
Wait.

570
01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.608
It's not attacking.

571
01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:51.213
It's going across,
it's not attacking.

572
01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.170
I've never seen it
do this before.

573
01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.340
My God.

574
01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.173
It can't be.

575
01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.544
Who is it, Jay?

576
01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.513
My wife.

577
01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:35.925
It's my wife.

578
01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.271
I can get you through.

579
01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:51.874
You're going in?

580
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.144
I am.

581
01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.248
Let me set up first.

582
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:06.189
Jesse...

583
01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.858
Hurry, Jesse.

584
01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.866
You nod as soon as you're ready.

585
01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:29.179
I'm ready.

586
01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:35.319
Go.

587
01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:07.384
Jay! Run!

588
01:19:10.382 --> 01:19:13.490
Sira! Sira, wake up.

589
01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:16.387
Are you OK?

590
01:19:20.357 --> 01:19:22.193
Where's Jay?

591
01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:25.196
He's gone.

592
01:19:43.247 --> 01:19:45.150
Who is it?

593
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:47.352
It's my mother.

594
01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:49.720
It's my mother.

595
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:57.493
Sira, no. You can't go.
You saw what happened to Jay.

596
01:19:57.495 --> 01:19:59.297
- Sira, no.
- I'm going.

597
01:20:00.198 --> 01:20:01.832
Will you help me?

598
01:20:03.501 --> 01:20:05.370
Will you help me?

599
01:20:20.585 --> 01:20:24.356
- Sira, your scanner.
- I don't need it.

600
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:47.178
Sira!

601
01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.949
<i>"The breezes at dawn
have secrets to tell you,</i>

602
01:20:52.951 --> 01:20:55.251
<i>don't go back to sleep.</i>

603
01:20:55.253 --> 01:20:58.870
<i>You must ask
for what you really want,</i>

604
01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:00.250
<i>don't go back to sleep."</i>

605
01:21:08.434 --> 01:21:09.834
Oh, no.

606
01:21:13.204 --> 01:21:15.273
She was my wish.

607
01:21:44.203 --> 01:21:45.971
You have to decide.

608
01:21:47.907 --> 01:21:49.506
I can't.

609
01:21:49.508 --> 01:21:51.377
Follow your heart.

610
01:21:55.648 --> 01:21:57.850
We don't have much time.

611
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.289
It's breaking down!

612
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:39.957
"People are going back and forth

613
01:22:39.959 --> 01:22:43.280
across the doorsill
where the two worlds touch.

614
01:22:44.196 --> 01:22:46.199
The door is round and open,

615
01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:50.102
don't go back to sleep."

616
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.253
Are you OK?

617
01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:42.389
You saved Lilly.

618
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:45.125
You did good.

619
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:55.330
What's that?

620
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:56.802
It's a letter from my mum.

621
01:23:56.804 --> 01:23:59.474
It was just over there
in the grass.

622
01:24:01.508 --> 01:24:03.109
Shall we open it?

623
01:24:15.188 --> 01:24:16.691
It's another map.

624
01:24:35.476 --> 01:24:37.770
This can't be...

625
01:24:39.346 --> 01:24:40.581
I know where this is.

626
01:24:45.386 --> 01:24:47.186
What do you think?

627
01:24:47.188 --> 01:24:48.623
I think we go.

628
01:24:50.257 --> 01:24:51.726
It's a long way.

629
01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:55.263
It's OK.

630
01:24:57.164 --> 01:24:58.700
It's been a long way already.

631
